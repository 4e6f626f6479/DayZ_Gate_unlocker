# DayZ_Gate_unlocker
Macro to decode DayZ Standalone combination Locks

Install instructions:
1. Download / install Autohotkey
2. run macro

Use Instructions:
1. run macro
2. tab into DayZ and interact with codelock
4. CTRL+K to activate macro
5. CTRL+L to exit macro 

If you tab out, or something else interrupts the macro, the macro will break. 
Just exit and restart with the number the lock is currently at. 
As you will automatically stop interacting with the lock once the correct combination is found, thre won't be an issue with overshooting anyway.
Just remember to CTRL+L once the code is unlocked

Happy Raiding!



works 99% of the time. 1% seems to be network issues unfortunately

Timings seem to differ between private test server and public server. Might want to fiddle with that some more


to do: 
abort / reset
randomise timings
improve speed

rewrite to allow start with known values
rewrite to make it not rely on the 10x loop and follow better coding practise (lol)
